This is a project to creating a docker container on a raspberry pi. The goal is to create a Flask application in a docker container which can then be called from outside the raspberrypi to get the temperature value.

This is based heavily on bmwshop's sensehat project where he made it as small as possible. I created the python program and more or less took his Dockerfile.
